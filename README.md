# Project-1

In this readme we will explain how to run each code of each exercise.

## Problem 2

You should first open the file "Problem2a" on your favourite C++ compiler, compile it, link it and execute it. It will generate a file named "test.txt" with values for x and the function u(x). Once you have done it, you have to open the file "Problem2b" on your Python compiler and run it. You will get a plot of the funtion u(x) in a .pdf format.


## Problem 6

You should first open the file "Problem6.cpp" and copy the code inside to the compiler of your choice. Once you've done it, you can introduce the dimension n of the solution v you want to get, any matrix you want(introducing the three vectors that correspond to the three diagonals and the vector g. If you omit this last step, the program will still work, because there is already an example with n=10 in it. After that, you should compile it, link it (including the armadillo extension) and execute it. You are supposed to receive as a feedback the solution v.


## Problem 7


## Problem 8

### Section a

You should open the file "Problem8a(graphics).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get a plot of the errors in a .pdf format. This plot represents the logarithm (in base ten) of the absolute error against x for each n.

### Section b

You should open the file "Problem8b(graphics).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get a plot of the errors in a .pdf format. This plot represents the logarithm (in base ten) of the relative error against x for each n.

### Section c

You should open the file "Problem8b(table).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get an array with the maximun relative error for each n=10^i, where i is the position of each value of the array (starting in 1).


## Problem 9


## Problem 10

For this program you should open the file "Problem10.cpp", copy the code inside to the compiler of your choice, compile it, link it(including the armadillo extension) and execute it. You are supposed to receive as feedback two vector with the timings that each code has used. You'll also receive a .txt document with both vectors. Each time that you run the code, you'll receive slightly different results.
