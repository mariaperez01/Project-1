# Project-1
For problem 2 you should open the file "problem2a" on your favourite C++ compiler, compile it, link it and execute it. It will generate a file named "test.txt" with values for x and the function u(x). Once you have done it, you have to open the file "problem2b" on your Python compiler and run it. You will get a plot of the funtion u(x) in a .pdf format.

For problem 6

For problem 7

For problem 8, section a, you should open the file "Problem8a(graphics).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get a plot of the errors in a .pdf format. This plot represents the logarithm (in base ten) of the absolute error against x for each n.
For problem 8, section b, you should open the file "Problem8b(graphics).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get a plot of the errors in a .pdf format. This plot represents the logarithm (in base ten) of the relative error against x for each n.
For problem 8, section c, you should open the file "Problem8b(table).py" on your Python compiler and run it once you have saved the diferent "vx_solution.txt" in the same folder (_ stands for any of these numbers 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000). You will get an array with the maximun relative error for each n=10^i, where i is the position of each value of the array (starting in 1).
