# Project-1
For problem 2 you should open the file "problem2a" on your favourite C++ compiler, compile it, link it and execute it. It will generate a file named "test.txt" with values for x and the function u(x). Once you have done it, you have to open the file "problem2b" on your Python compiler and run it. You will get a plot of the funtion u(x) in a .pdf format.
